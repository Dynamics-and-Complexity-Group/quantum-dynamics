## Description

The repository contains two complementary numerical approaches to study tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential:

1. **Dynamical Systems Approach**  
   Implements the reduced four-dimensional dynamical system derived from the Ehrenfest equations to model the time evolution of the mean and variance.

2. **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Simulations**  
   Solves the Schrödinger equation using the **Crank–Nicolson method** to visualize wavepacket tunneling between the two wells.
